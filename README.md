Hello!
This is my first mini project!


A few words about project:
1. I used next Libraries 
    - beautiful soup
    - cleantext
    - nltk
    - sqlAlchemy
    - asyncio
    - all information writes to sqlite3 database with mane_to_many relationships.
2. In /scrapy/config.py file contains the following settings:
    - global variables
    - python_frameworks(list with all frameworks which we will look for)
    - python_vacancies(list with all vacancies which we will look for)
3. If you want parse not python vacancies you could change BASE_PYTHON_URL, and actual frameworks and vacancies in the files above.
4. I left a file to show you what information we will look for in the djinni.
